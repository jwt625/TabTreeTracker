## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension not tracking tabs**
- Ensure tracking is enabled (toggle switch in popup)
- Check if the current domain is in excluded domains list
- Verify extension has necessary permissions

**Tree not displaying**
- Try refreshing the viewer page
- Clear tree data and start fresh
- Check browser console for error messages

**Performance issues**
- Enable automatic data cleanup in options
- Reduce data retention period
- Clear old tree data manually

**Content analysis not working**
- Ensure content analysis is enabled in options
- Check if current site allows content scripts
